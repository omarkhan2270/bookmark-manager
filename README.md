#As a time-pressed user
#So that I can quickly go to web sites I regularly visit
#I would like to see a list of bookmarks

# Connect to psql
# Create the database using the psql command: CREATE DATABASE bookmark_manager;
# Connect to the database using the psql command \c bookmark_manager;
# Run the query we have saved in the file 01_create_bookmarks_table.sql
